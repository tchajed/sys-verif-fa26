## Developing

You'll need Node.js and pnpm. You can probably use `corepack enable pnpm` to install pnpm (corepack is now packaged with node), but follow the [corepack](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) instructions if that doesn't work.

Install the dependencies: `pnpm install`.

Run a dev server to preview changes: `pnpm dev`. The dev server auto-updates and hot-reloads page content, but not structure. Restart it if you make structural changes that affect the sidebar (e.g., add new files), or start it with `pnpm dev --debug` to do a more expensive reload on every change.

Auto-format code (with [prettier](https://prettier.io/)): `pnpm fmt`.

Build static site: `pnpm build`.

## Contributing

Make sure to preview your change with `pnpm dev`: confirm that it compiles, and if any LaTeX is involved, make sure the output doesn't render with red errors.

Run `pnpm fmt`.

You can use the provided git pre-commit hook (in `.git-hooks/`) to automatically format your code (you will need to run `pnpm install` first). Set it up with `git config core.hooksPath .git-hooks/`.

## Tech stack

- pnpm for package management
- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
  - Using the [VuePress Hope theme](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/) (rather than the default)
  - Pretty much the whole setup is in [config.ts](docs/.vuepress/config.ts). YAML frontmatter in individual pages takes care of some aspects.
- Build and deploy via [GitHub Pages workflow](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
